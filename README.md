# ML with NumPy

In this project, I use NumPy to recreate some of the commonly used machine learning algorithms used today. The algorithms that I explore include:

- KNN using Euclidean/ Manhattan Distances
- Decision Trees using ID3 Algorithm (information gain with entropy/ prior probabilities)
- Linear and Polynomial Regression using Perceptron Algorithm
- Gradient Descent with different loss functions (Sqaured Loss, HingeLoss) and L1/L2 Regularizers
- Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models
- Deep Learning Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning with multi-armed-bandit problem and QLearning
